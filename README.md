# MIDI-Accompaniment-Generator

For amateur music enthusiasts, music production is a challenging and systematic work. Our project aims to provide an easy-to-use MIDI music production tool for them. Users will be able to input notes via entering key parameters to generate their own melodies. Our software will analyze the user's melodies and generate appropriate accompaniment. The generated music will be stored in MIDI format for convenient replay. To accommodate the different usage habits of users, they will be able to choose to input notes via keyboard, a graphical interface, or pre-written text format music score to generate basic melodies. We use python as the programming language and include several libraries to support music generation and MIDI file production. By using our program, users will be able to transform the melodies in their minds into reality easily, and create music that includes basic melodies and different accompaniments through a series of simple operations. 

To use console mode:

python basic.py

To use console mode with music score:

python basic.py your_music_score.txt

You can try our example by running:

python basic.py two_tigers_major.txt

To use graphic mode:

python interface.py
